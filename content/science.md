Our vision
==========

Currently, there are numerous serious threats to marine predators in the Southern Ocean: namely climate change, fisheries, and direct human disturbance. However, despite over a hundred years of study in the region, we have little baseline information against which to measure change. As we move away from scientific bases, less data is available on populations of predators and, consequently, huge gaps remain in our understanding of the Antarctic ecosystem.

As top predators, penguins are considered sentinels of changes within their ecosystem. Because penguins spend the majority of their life in water and fall at the top of the food chain, any variations in their populations may represent larger changes to the dynamic Antarctic ecosystem. We hope to measure these changes year- round at a large geographical range of study sites in order to better understand how threats to the ecosystem disrupt the dynamics of resident wildlife.

Why cameras?
------------

Camera technology affords us the ability to deploy ‘artificial ecologists’ in hard-to-reach areas, or in places where human presence might disturb wildlife and therefore disrupt their behavior. By establishing a camera network in the Southern Ocean, a region of the world with harsh conditions year-round, we hope to capture novel behaviors and study penguin populations that have never before been observed because of their remote locations.

However, along with the infinite possibilities of cameras as a monitoring tool comes an enormous amount of data in the form of hundreds of thousands of images. Each of our 50 cameras takes between 8 to 96 images daily throughout the entire year. In order to turn this massive database of information into a data set that we can use to answer hypotheses, we need your collective help.

Project goals
-------------

Images provide the ability to ask and answer a range of questions depending on the location, study species, and the size of the colony. Although penguins are relatively well studied, the harsh Antarctic environment makes monitoring wildlife difficult compared to other ecosystems. Therefore, to paint a better picture of future changes to colonies and populations, we hope to create an expansive monitoring network, consisting of many years of observation, to answer big picture questions.

Specifically, we aim...

- To determine changes in the timing of breeding of populations over time (eg. arrival and departure dates, hatching dates, incubation period, guard and post-guard periods).

- To compare nest survival rates between populations and determine whether low nest survival is linked to anthropogenic or ecological factors present near the colonies.

- To reveal the rate of predation on chicks at each sites, the main predators and scavengers present, the peak timing of predation, and any mass predation events.

- To determine whether particular colonies overwinter at breeding sites and if this behavior is mediated by the presence of certain sea ice types.
